### Aspire with Dapr
* Dapr workflow does not work with Worker asp.net temple as it requires an Http endpoint. Use Web api template to write Dapr workflow.

Aspire with Dapr
https://github.com/SiddyHub/DaprWithAspire

### Dapr

## Workflow
* Go to Dapr side car (*-dapr-cli) in Aspire and click View details in overflow button
* Select Http Endpoint port number (i.e 49677)
### Start workflow
    Start Workflow: POST http://localhost:49677/v1.0-beta1/workflows/dapr/AsyncWorkflow/start

     

### Check workflow status
    Check Workflow Status: http://localhost:49677/v1.0-beta1/workflows/dapr/<instance-id>

### Azure Container Apps

### Routing
* Prefer Attribute-based routing over conventional routing
* In Attribute based routing, prefer [HttpGet] pattern over [Route]
* ```Route["api/[controller"]]``` is called token replacement.
* Route templates applied to an action that begin with ```/``` or ```~/``` don't get combined with the route templates applied to the controller.
* ```[HttpGet]``` GET /api/order
* ```[HttpGet("{id}")]``` GET /api/order/abc
* ```[HttpGet("status/{id}")]``` GET /api/order/status/abc

## Lean Architecture

Clean Architecture has this Application Layer.
- Infastructure --> Application (UseCases) --> Core(Domain)
- Infrastructure --> Core(Domain)

How abt if we remove Application layer and put everything in Core.?

UI --> Api --> Infrastructure --> Core --> Shared

Shared: Any utilities project that might be used to share across multiple repositoris

### Deploy a cloud-native application automatically

The code in this repository supports a Learn module focused on automating CI/CD with .NET. The module shows you how to:

- Authenticate GitHub Actions to a container registry.
- Securely store sensitive information that GitHub Actions uses.
- Implement an action to build the container image for a microservice.
- Modify and commit the microservice code to trigger a build.
- Implement an action to deploy the updated container to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
- Modify and commit a Helm chart to trigger the deployment.
- Revert the microservice to the previous deployment.
